Here's a port of jotp to J2ME so that it can be used on cell phones that supports Java. I made this so that I can securely connect to our ssh-server from insecure internet cafees, where people might be trying to sniff my passsword.

Basicly it's just a MIDlet interface to Harry Mantakos OTP (s/key) calculator.
